# Caesar-Cipher-
The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest encryption techniques, invented by Julius Caesar. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A becomes D. Though simple and easy to use, it offers very low security and can be easily decrypted.
